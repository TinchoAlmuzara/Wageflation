# Wageflation
This repository contains the Matlab and Stata scripts to reproduce all the calculations, figures and tables in "A Measure of Trend Wage Inflation" (M. Almuzara, R. Audoly and D. Melcangi).

The **description.pdf** file contains a detailed description of each file. 

The material is organized as follows:
  - The **scripts** directory contains the main files to replicate calculations, figures and tables in the paper.
  - The **functions** directory contains auxiliary functions to implement estimation and inference in our model.
  - The **data** directory contains the data used in the empirical analysis.
  - The **build_cps_data** directory contains Stata code to reconstruct our main dataset from the CPS raw data.
